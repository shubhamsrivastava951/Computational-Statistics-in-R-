#### Overview of the problem

* Cold calling is the process in which salespeople contact potential customers with no prior interest in the product. As such, these calls are estimated to convert to a sale very rarely; about 2% of the time according to marketer Charlie Cook.
* The purpose of this task is to determine whether a customer will subscribe to a bank deposit from a Portuguese bank, given certain information about that customer.
* This problem falls under the branch of binary classification; given a feature vector of information from a particular customer, the goal is to output either yes or no.
* This problem is interesting as it would help improve the performance of ‘cold calling’.
*  By solving the classification problem, we are able to reduce the customer pool and hence increase efficiency by only calling the customers who have a high probability of subscribing to a term deposit.


# [Churn Analysis for Bank using Machine Learning - Pyhton] (https://github.com/shubhamsrivastava951/Computational-Statistics-in-R-/tree/main/Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction-master/Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction-master)

### Project Description

* Developed a customer churn prediction model with 94% precision, enabling the bank to proactively identify and retain at-risk customers, significantly improving customer retention rates and maximizing revenue.
* Conducted thorough data analysis and preprocessing to ensure data quality.
* Employed various machine learning algorithms and identified random forest as the most effective with 85% accuracy and 0.87 ROC/AUC score.
* Enhanced model accuracy to 94% through hyperparameter tuning and grid search cross-validation.
* Generated actionable insights by identifying 800 at-risk customers and churn factors, guiding effective retention strategies.
