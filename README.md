#### Overview of the problem

* The Cold calling is the process in which salespeople contact potential customers with no prior interest with the product. As such, these calls are estimated to convert to a sale very rarely; about 2% of the time according to marketer Charlie Cook.
* The purpose of this task is to determine whether a customer will subscribe to a bank deposit from a Portuguese bank, given certain information about that customer.
* This problem falls under the branch of binary classification; given a feature vector of information from a particular customer, the goal is to output either yes or no.
* This problem is interesting as it would help improve the performance of ‘cold calling’.
*  By solving the classification problem, we are able to reduce the customer pool and hence increase efficiency by only calling the customers who have a high probability of subscribing to a term deposit.
